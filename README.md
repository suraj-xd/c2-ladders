## Problem Solving Approach 🛠️

My approach to each problem is a well-crafted dance of logic and creativity:

1. **Problem Statement** 📜: I dive deep into the problem statement, deciphering inputs, outputs, constraints, and requirements. The story begins here.

2. **Algorithm Design** 🎯: Armed with insights, I orchestrate a symphony of algorithms, plotting an efficient path to victory.

3. **Implementation** 💻: With a blueprint in hand, I craft clean, organized code, letting the solution come to life.

4. **Testing** 🧪: Before the grand reveal, I test my creation with sample cases, ensuring my solution stands strong.

5. **Key Takeaways** 🧠: With each conquest, I gather precious gems—data structures, algorithms, patterns—that shine in my arsenal.
